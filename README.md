# exercise-09-weather

We're going to build a page to track weather data

We will use the https://home.openweathermap.org/ API service

## Code concepts
- We will use Builder design pattern for building the API url call. 
- We will use Cachng mechnism to store the data returned from API.

## The page
The page will contain an input search box for entering a city name. After pressing the enter button or the add button a new card is created with the weather information of the city typed in the search box.
